A simple class roster app for the masses.


Session 1:
Create a Person class in Swift with the following functionality:
* Properties for a personâ€™s first name and last name and a bool declaring if the person is a student or not
* An init method that takes in 3 parameters that are used to set each property on the person.
* A method that returns the persons full name (the first name and last name combined!)

Session 2:
In your ViewController class:
* Add a property called myPerson that is of type Person, the class we made in the first homework.
* Add a button to your view controller via storyboard.
* Hook up an @IBAction from the button to your ViewController.Swift file. This will create a method that will fire every time the user presses on your button.
* Inside this method, print your myPerson's full name to the console.

In your storyboard:
*Drag out a 2nd View Controller from the object library.
*Add a 2nd button, that fires a segue to a second view controller when pressed.

Session 3:
Replace whatever interface you have (random labels and button) with a table view. This table view should display a list Person object's names.

Session 4:
* Embed your main view controller (the one with the table view) in a navigation controller.
* Create a 2nd view controller class and name it DetailViewController. 
* Drag out a view controller in storyboard, and set its class to DetailViewController
* Create a show segue from your table view cell to your detail view controller on your storyboard.
* Using prepareForSegue(), pass the person they clicked on in the tableview to the detail view controller
* Show the person's first and last name in separate labels on the detail view controller.


Session 5:
* Replace the UILabels with UITextFields
* When the user presses the return key, dismiss the keyboard.
* Use autolayout to layout your detail view controller so that it looks good in both portrait and landscape modes.
* Add an optional UIImage property to your Person class.

Session 6:
* Implement a UIImagePickerController into your app. Launch via a button press, just like i did in class.
* Upon the user choosing or taking a photo, set your image view on your detail view controller to show that image
* Also set the selectedPerson's image property to be the chosen image as well.

Session 7:
* Create a custom table view cell with an image view and label
* Convert your app to use your custom cell instead of a regular uitableviewcell
* Create a plist with a root array, and fill it with dictionaries, each with a last name and first name key value pairing
* In code, load and parse through the plist and create a person object for each dictionary. Add each person to your people array so your table view can show these people.


Session 8 - Final:
* Implement persistence into your app. Skip NSUserDefaults for now, use the NSCoding protocol and NSKeyedArchiver/Unarchiver to persist your people array to disk. 
* Make sure you have all the functionality from the previous assignments as well, this should be a pretty fully functioning app at this point.
