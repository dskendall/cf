A simple class roster app for the masses

Session 8:
Implement persistence into your app. Skip NSUserDefaults for now, use the NSCoding protocol and NSKeyedArchiver/Unarchiver to persist your people array to disk. 
Make sure you have all the functionality from the previous assignments as well, this should be a pretty fully functioning app at this point.
