Assignment 2
In your ViewController class:

Add a property called myPerson that is of type Person, the class we made in the first homework.
Add a button to your view controller via storyboard.
Hook up an @IBAction from the button to your ViewController.Swift file. This will create a method that will fire every time the user presses on your button.
Inside this method, print your myPerson's full name to the console.
In your storyboard:

Drag out a 2nd View Controller from the object library.
Add a 2nd button, that fires a segue to a second view controller when pressed.
